# **F-MRI Metabolism Quantification Using 3FDG and 3FDGal**

## **Introduction**
Brain metabolism plays a pivotal role in understanding neurological processes, including normal function and disease states. This project aims to develop a Python-based analytical tool to quantify and visualize real-time metabolic changes in the brain using MRI data and fluorinated probes, **3FDG** and **3FDGal**.

The tool will focus on automating data analysis and providing researchers with intuitive visualizations of metabolite activity, enabling in-depth insights into biochemical dynamics over time.

## **Features**
1. **Image Analysis**:
   - Supports TIF image files for:
     - **Anatomical data** (proton-based images).
     - **Metabolite-specific data** (e.g., 3FDG and 3FDGal signals).

2. **Signal Quantification**:
   - Automatically identifies and quantifies metabolite-specific signals.
   - Focuses on key regions of interest (ROIs) defined by users.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Time-series plots to show changes in metabolite activity over time.
   - Heatmaps to highlight active regions in the brain.

4. **Output**:
   - Generates clear visualizations for presentations or publications.
   - Exports quantified data in CSV or Excel formats for further analysis.

## **Future Extensions**
1. **Enhanced Input Formats**:
   - Support for 3D MRI data, such as NIfTI files, to enable broader compatibility.

2. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**:
   - Incorporate SNR calculations to filter and quantify high-quality signals more accurately.

3. **Automated ROI Detection**:
   - Develop machine learning models to identify regions of interest (ROIs) automatically.

4. **Integration of Clinical Data**:
   - Extend functionality to compare brain metabolism under different conditions (e.g., healthy vs. pathological states).
